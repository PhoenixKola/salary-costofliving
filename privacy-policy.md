# Privacy Policy — Kosto Jetese Shqiperi

_Last updated: 2026-02-19_

Kosto Jetese Shqiperi (“the App”) helps you view official wage and inflation (CPI) trends for Albania and create a simple monthly budget estimate.

## What data we collect
**We do not ask for or collect personal information** such as your name, email address, phone number, contacts, photos, or precise location.

## Data stored on your device
The App stores the following **locally on your device** (on-device storage) to remember your preferences and improve offline access:
- Selected language (Albanian/English)
- Cached statistics data (so the app can display the latest loaded values offline)
- Budget scenario settings (e.g., city, lifestyle, household size, rent)

This data stays on your device and is not sent to us.

## Data the App fetches
The App fetches statistics from **publicly available sources**:
- Official statistics published by INSTAT (Albanian Institute of Statistics)
- The App may read a publicly hosted JSON file generated by the project’s data pipeline (for example, `latest.json`) which is derived from the official INSTAT tables.

The App displays the relevant data source inside the interface.

## Advertising
The App displays ads and uses third-party advertising SDKs (for example, Google Mobile Ads / AdMob).

These SDKs may automatically collect certain device and usage information in order to serve and measure ads. This may include:
- IP address (used for network communication)
- Approximate location inferred from IP (depending on ad network settings)
- Ad performance and interaction data (e.g., impressions, clicks)
- Basic device information (such as device model, OS version)

We do not use this information to identify you personally.

You can reset or limit ad personalization from your device settings:
- Android: **Settings → Privacy → Ads** (wording may vary by Android version)

## Analytics
The App does not use a separate in-app analytics product to track you (beyond what advertising SDKs may collect for ad measurement).

## Sharing
We do not sell your personal data.  
However, **ad providers** may process certain data (described above) to provide advertising and measure performance.

## Security
The App does not use accounts or passwords. It downloads public statistics data and stores only local preferences on your device.

## Children’s privacy
The App is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
